# Medical Data Parser

The following project is designed to read in a CSV data file and format the patient's data entries into chronological order and then assess which records have more than X number of consecutive years, the output of which is recorded in two separate files for manual assessment.

Some data clusters have a varying amount of fields, so the program dynamically assesses which fields are missing and adds them to the end file.
